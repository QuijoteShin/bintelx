; /var/www/bintelx/bintelx/config/server/php.pool.conf
; This is the name of your pool. It will appear in PHP-FPM logs.
[bintelx]

; The Unix socket PHP-FPM will listen on. This is correct.
; Ensure NGINX's fastcgi_pass directive points to this exact path.
listen = /run/php/php8.4-fpm-bintelx.sock

; --- Socket Permissions ---
; The user and group that will own the socket file.
; This must be the user/group PHP-FPM runs as OR a group that NGINX also belongs to.
listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data
; The permissions for the socket file (rw-rw----)
; Ensures the owner (www-data) and group (www-data) can read/write to the socket.
; If NGINX runs as a different user (e.g., 'nginx') and is not in 'www-data' group,
; you might need to add 'nginx' user to 'www-data' group or change 'listen.group = nginx'.
listen.mode = 0660

; --- PHP-FPM Process User and Group ---
; The user and group under which the PHP worker processes will run.
; This is crucial for file system permissions when PHP scripts access files (e.g., writing logs, uploads).
user = www-data
group = www-data

; --- Process Management (VERY IMPORTANT for performance) ---
; Controls how child processes are managed.
; 'dynamic' is common for web servers with varying load.
; 'ondemand' is good for low-traffic sites to save memory.
; 'static' is for very high-traffic, predictable load.
; pm = dynamic
; pm.max_children = 50       ; The maximum number of child processes to be created.
; pm.start_servers = 5       ; The number of child processes created on startup.
; pm.min_spare_servers = 5   ; The minimum number of idle server processes.
; pm.max_spare_servers = 15  ; The maximum number of idle server processes.
; pm.max_requests = 500      ; The number of requests each child process should execute before respawning.
                           ; Prevents memory leaks from long-running processes.

; --- Resource Limits (Optional but often useful) ---
; php_admin_value[max_execution_time] = 30  ; This is the PHP internal timeout.
                                            ; NGINX's fastcgi_read_timeout should be higher.
; request_terminate_timeout = 60s           ; Force terminate script
                                            ; Should be >= max_execution_time and slightly less than NGINX's fastcgi_read_timeout.
; php_admin_value[memory_limit] = 600M
; php_admin_value[upload_max_filesize] = 400M
; php_admin_value[post_max_size] = 400M
; php_admin_value[display_errors] = Off
; php_admin_flag[log_errors] = On
; php_admin_value[error_log] = /var/www/bintelx/log/fpm-error.log

; --- Chroot (Optional, for higher security) ---
; chroot = /var/www/bintelx/ ; Confines PHP processes to this directory.
                               ; Requires careful setup for paths and includes.

; --- Environment Variables ---
; env[MY_APP_ENV] = production
